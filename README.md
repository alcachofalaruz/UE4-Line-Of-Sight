# UE4-Line-Of-Sight
Line of sight systems, with custom visbility checks, smooth rotation and movement, and customizable, made into a component, so its almost plug and play, the only thing needed its a Sight Trace channel.

It's fully comented, cleary divided and easy to understand.

The idea its to grab this system and customize it for your own game :D
